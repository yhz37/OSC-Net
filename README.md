# OSC-Net: A Multi-Fidelity Machine Learning Model for Organic Solar Cell

Official implementation of **OSC-Net**, a multi-fidelity machine learning framework developed to predict the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs) by integrating low-fidelity computational data and high-fidelity experimental measurements.

## 🔍 Overview

Using a hierarchical learning strategy:
1. **Pre-training on LF data**  
2. **Fine-tuning on HF experimental data**

The result is a model that generalizes well and enables accurate OSC performance prediction with limited high-cost experimental data.
